# Boss Machine

## Project Overview

This project is part of the CodeCademy full stack developer course. In this project, I create an API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today's most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. I have created routes to manage the 'minions', 'million dollar ideas', and 'meetings'.


## How to Use

Once you have the project downloaded, you'll need to run some terminal commands to get the application started. First, open the root project directory in your terminal. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies of this project and build the front-end application. Once it has finished installing, you can run `npm run start` to begin your server. You'll see `Server listening on port 4001` in the terminal. To see the application simply open **index.html** in a web browser. You should use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) (at least version 60) or [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) (at least version 55).
